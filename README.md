# LÖVE 2D TypeScript Project Boilerplate

To get a head start into a LÖVE 2D TypeScript Project, you'll need to be able to run the commands below.

To do that you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run them.

On the command line, `lovec` should launch LÖVE 2D. Follow [this guide](https://love2d.org/wiki/PATH) if you need to set this up.

All ready? Run the commands below.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hazzard993/love-typescript-boilerplate my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm install   # Again
npm run build
npm start
```

Your project should now be running!

## Making changes

1. Modify the `.ts` files under `src` or create some new ones
2. Execute `npm run build` to build the `.lua` files
3. Execute `npm start` to run your project again
4. Head back to step 1 and make your changes again

Alternatively, you can run `npm run watch` to automatically re-transpile files you modify, keep another terminal handy to run `npm start` when you want to run the project.
